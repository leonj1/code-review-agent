Code Review Agent with Specialized Sub-Agents

This script demonstrates how to use the Claude Agent SDK to perform comprehensive
code reviews using specialized sub-agents. Each sub-agent focuses on a specific
aspect of code quality:

1. CorrectnessAgent - Logical errors and bugs
2. SecurityAgent - Security vulnerabilities
3. PerformanceAgent - Performance bottlenecks
4. StyleAgent - Readability and naming conventions
5. RobustnessAgent - Error handling and edge cases
6. StructureAgent - Code organization and architecture
7. TestingAgent - Unit and integration test quality
8. CoverageAgent - Test coverage analysis
9. DocumentationAgent - Comments and documentation quality

Usage:
    # Interactive mode - prompts for file path
    python code_review_agent.py --model sonnet

    # Automatic mode - reviews file immediately
    python code_review_agent.py --model sonnet --file path/to/file.py

    # With stats output
    python code_review_agent.py --model sonnet --file test_fixer.py --stats true

   - @SecurityAgent - for security vulnerabilities
   - @PerformanceAgent - for performance issues
   - @StyleAgent - for readability and style
   - @RobustnessAgent - for error handling
   - @StructureAgent - for code architecture
   - @TestingAgent - for test quality (if tests exist)
   - @CoverageAgent - for test coverage analysis (if tests exist)
   - @DocumentationAgent - for documentation quality

3. For each sub-agent, use the Task tool like this:
   @AgentName Please analyze the following code from [filename]:
   [paste the code content]
